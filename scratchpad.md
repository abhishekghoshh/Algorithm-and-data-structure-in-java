## For coding Interviews

- [ ] Prepare short and to the point **Introduce yourself**
- [ ] stay calm and first read the question and asked about it and see the input ranges and edge case
- [ ] start with brute force solution and the start the conversation
- [ ] Always go with the simple solutions which is easy to code
- [ ] Explain your thoughts and ask them if you're going to the right direction or not 
- [ ] Proper variable names, method names and use modular approach
- [ ] Dry run
- [ ] Discuss the time complexity
- [ ] At the end ask questions about project that your team/company is currently doing

## Stick to Basics. I would classify the following data structures as **must know**

- [ ] Array
- [ ] Linked List - Single and Doubly
- [ ] Stack
- [ ] Queues
- [ ] Binary Search Trees or general Binary Tree
- [ ] Heaps
- [ ] Basic Graph Traversal and Shortest Path
- [ ] Hashing

## Following data structures may be asked. I would say that their probability of being asked is between 50 to 75% -

- [ ] Tries
- [ ] Advance Graphs like flow and min-cut etc.
- [ ] Bit Manipulation

## You will probably crack interviews with sufficient knowledge of above. Following have very low probability of being asked ( < 25%) :

- [ ] Segment Trees / Binary Indexed Trees
- [ ] AVL Trees
- [ ] B+ Trees
- [ ] Suffix arrays and trees

## Other hard data structures are absolutely unnecessary. Following Algorithms / Tricks / Topics may also be important :

- [ ] Memory Management
- [ ] Basic Co-ordinate geometry - Manhattan Distance, Closest Point Pair
- [ ] Divide and Conquer
- [ ] Greedy
- [ ] Dynamic Programming - Extremely important
- [ ] Probability and basic Number Theory
- [ ] Sorting and Searching

## Following topics is important for Knowledge / Experience based questions :

- [ ] OS - Threads, Processes and Locks using Mutex, Semaphores (Operating systems Archives - GeeksforGeeks)
- [ ] Scalability Issues, RPCs, Rate limiter, etc.
- [ ] OOP Concepts
- [ ] Databases - SQL, NoSQL, Writing simple Queries, Transactions, ACID
- [ ] Linux Commands - sed, grep, ps, etc.
